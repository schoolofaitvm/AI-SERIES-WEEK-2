    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
    "    \"Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.\n",
    "    2 versions of Python is available for download. Python 2.x and 3.x (x represents the sub-version number). Versions in 2.x are older and does not have future support. It will be better to download 3.6 (3.7 is currently available). You can access the download page from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ . After downloading python, you can check the version of the python installed by using this command on the terminal ' python --version '. This will print the ersion number of the Python installed."

    "After installing Python 3.6 (or 3.x) properly, what you have got to do next is to download Anaconda distribution. The open source Anaconda Distribution is the fastest and easiest way to do Python and R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It's the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine. You can download the latest version of Anaconda from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/ . While installing Anaconda, some of the essential learning packages will also get installed (Jupyter Notebook, etc). \n",

    "Once Anaconda has been downloaded, pip has to be installed. Pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. Sometimes you will have to install some packages that are not available for download via Anaconda. In that situtaion, the best alternative is to call the package that have to be downloaded using pip.\n",

    "1. Using Colab - Colab is a powerful GPU accelerated platform provided by Google for free. It supports Python 3. You can connect your notebook to a power GPU as well. The best part is that, it is available for free. You can aslo save it your drive, etc. Access Collab here : [Google Collab](https://https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). Select File option and then select new Python 3 notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use Jupyter Notebook - To activate Jupyter Notebook, open your Anaconda Prompt and enter the following command ' Jupyter Notebook '. Within a few seconds, Jupyter Notebook will be activated on your default browser page. In that, some of the files in your system will be shown. You can even create a new folder from that page. On the top right side, you will find a 'new' option. When you click on that,you will see an option 'Python 3' under Notebook. You will be taken to another page where you can start writing some lines in python.[ press shift+enter to run the file easily and to launch next line]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python IDLE - Just search for Python IDLE (GUI) in your system and and launch that. Select 'File' option and select 'New' . This will launch a new interface, where you can start programming. Save the file before running it.\n",
